# ImgGenerator
This is a simple image generator side-project I've made in order to try some new things using Angular, TailwindCSS and the OpenAi API.

If you want to try it, insert your own API Key in the `src/app/service/prompt.service.ts` file. Then run the server :
```bash
ng serve
```
And visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200):
